I've joined the #30DaysOfCode Challenge
Checkout my Progress Log : log.txt

The main aim is to Work on real projects, face real challenges, the time spent on tutorials and online contents and other similar resources wil not count towards this challenge. If you are new to coding it's fine to push even a basic simple code to your repository.

Also check out the resources which I prefer to learn and work on.

Give a â˜… to this repo if you would like to encourage and support my work.
